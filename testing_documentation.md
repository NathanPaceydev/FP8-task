# FP8 Conversion Test Cases

The following test cases are designed to validate the functionality of custom FP8 (8-bit floating-point) conversion and reconstruction functions. They cover a range of scenarios to ensure accurate conversions for typical values, proper handling of special floating-point values, and the correct application of scaling factors.

## Test Case: `test_round_to_fp8_represented_as_int8`

This test verifies the conversion of bfloat16 tensors to the FP8 format, focusing on:
- Ensuring the resulting FP8 tensor is of the `uint8` data type.
- Comparing the FP8 conversion results with a reference NumPy implementation to ensure consistency between the TorchScript and NumPy approaches.

## Test Case: `test_undo_int8_fp8`

This test checks the reconstruction of bfloat16 tensors from their FP8 representation, ensuring:
- The reconstructed tensor is of the `bfloat16` data type.
- The reconstructed values closely match the original bfloat16 values, validating the accuracy of the FP8 to bfloat16 conversion process.

## Test Case: `test_special_values`

This test focuses on the handling of special floating-point values (0, positive/negative infinity, and NaN) during FP8 conversion, ensuring:
- Zeros and infinities are correctly represented in the FP8 format.
- NaNs are represented using a specific FP8 pattern (e.g., `255`), validating the handling of these edge cases.

## Test Case: `test_scaling_factor_effectiveness`

This test assesses the effectiveness of a scaling factor in the FP8 conversion process, particularly for tensors with small values. It verifies:
- The correct application of a scaling factor to enhance the representational range of FP8 for small values.
- The accurate reconstruction of tensor values after applying and reversing the scaling factor, ensuring non-negative reconstructed values that closely match the scaled originals.

### Considerations

- **FP8 Format Assumptions**: These tests assume a specific FP8 format (e.g., E5M2) and may require adjustments for different configurations.
- **Reference Implementations**: Functions `numpy_bfloat16_to_fp8` and `numpy_fp8_to_bfloat16` are used as reference implementations to validate TorchScript functions. It's crucial to ensure these NumPy functions are correctly implemented and aligned with the assumed FP8 format.
- **Handling Special Values**: Careful attention is required for how special floating-point values are represented and reconstructed in FP8 to avoid incorrect test outcomes.
- **Scaling Factor**: The scaling factor test should carefully choose the factor and verify its correct application and reversal in both conversion and reconstruction processes.

Collectively, these test cases ensure the robustness and correctness of the FP8 conversion and reconstruction implementation, covering everything from normal operation to edge cases.
